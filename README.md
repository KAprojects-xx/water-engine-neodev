# Water Engine — NeoDev Project

## Overview
This project explains and demonstrates two concepts:
1. **Electrolysis** — splitting water using electricity to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
2. **Water Hammer** — using sudden pressure spikes created when flowing water is abruptly stopped.

This is a **theoretical hardware sustainability concept**, not a working engine.  
The goal is to show how water-based systems can transfer energy through pressure and chemistry.

## What We Showed
- Electrolysis explanation
- Water-hammer explanation
- Diagrams and theory
- How these ideas could be parts of a future water-based engine

## Files
- **README.md** — full project documentation
- **video_link.txt** — contains the YouTube link
- **diagram.png** (optional) — concept diagram

## Team
- Kavindran Aravindhan  
- Daniil Ansimov

## Safety Notes
- Electrolysis should only use low voltage (AA or 9V battery)
- Do not seal containers of gas
- Water hammer pressure can be strong — real systems require reinforced pipes

## Purpose
This project is for the NeoDev sustainability challenge.  
It focuses on **innovation, concept clarity, and environmental thinking**, not building a full mechanical engine.
